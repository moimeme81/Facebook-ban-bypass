<p>The purpose of this site is to bypass censorship of the media by social media companies and allow you to share news articles on social media like Facebook.</p>

<form action="submit.php" method="POST"><label for="url">URL:</label> <input id="url" name="url" pattern="https?://.*" required="" type="url" /><br />
<br />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" /></form>

<p>Enter a valid URL in the text box above and it should appear as the last URL in the drop-down menu in the header. If that doesn&#39;t happen either your URL wasn&#39;t valid or you need to refresh the page.</p>

<p>Please be comprehensive about the 1992 look as I&#39;m no programmer and worked on this as a dare to myself to see if I could find a way around the ban of news on social media in Canada. This is very much a work in progress so there&#39;s probably some bugs and other problems. It&#39;s also possible that your URL will not load as the method may be blocked by the creator of the original content, this is why there&#39;s a button to go to the actual page of the content you are trying to share, use it and explore the myriad of incredible content that is created by news agencies.</p>

<p>This is a project that was made with the profound belief that preventing news to be shared is deeply anti-democratic and could very well be unsafe as many people gather news on social media (ie: forest fires all around Canada)</p>
